### A Gedankenexperiment

In science, and physics in particular, there is a tool called a 'Gedankenexperiment', or thought experiment. If we have a model of how something in the world works, we can imagine the extreme limits of what is possible, to test if the model makes sense. 
Many important physics gedankenexperiments come from Albert Einstein, imagining what would happen to a train if it traveled near the speed of light. It's not practical to build an actual train that travels near the speed of light, but by using our knowledge of how the everyday world works, we can see if our models of the world can consistently explain what happens on the train. 
By imagining the extreme consequences of a given model, gedankenexperiments can highlight and challenge the underlying assumptions we have about the world.

Here is a thought experiment: What if the law, i.e. the systems of ethics and power that human beings use to decide how to behave to each other, were a piece of open-source software? 

### Why Open Source?

Open source projects tend to attract people who are both interested and motivated. What would climate policy look like under a law written by climate experts? What would a public transit system look like, as designed by experts in civil engineering?

Sometimes bad actors will insert malicious code into open source projects, but when these actors get found out, the community responds to protect the integrity of the project. Specifically, I'm thinking of the recent banning of the University of Minnesota from making any further commits to the Linux kernel, after they tried to insert malicious code. 
People can make a new version of the code for malicious reasons, but the developers of the original project can say "hey, their code is doing something malicious, in this file, at this line". If somebody creates a version that isn't open-source (which might be an option depending on the license) you might not be able to tell if there's malicious code, but you should ask them why their version, that you can't see and you can't edit, is better. 

I want to put this little experiment out into the world, and see what people come up with. Maybe some folks will design a really good public transit system, and if that happens we can try to make that design into a reality. 

This initial version of Open Source Law starts with three rules. I certainly don't think they provide guidance for every situation, but I think they're a good starting point. If somebody does make a version of Open Source Law without these rules, I think it would be a very good idea to ask them exactly which part they disagree with. 

### The rules so far:

1. Any law is a tool, and that tool should only be used for the purpose of bettering the lives of all humanity, in specific, concrete, and identifiable ways. 
2. There is no thoughtcrime. No internal attitude or perspective is illegal, only external actions with real consequences. 
3. The law should be written with real people in mind, and not a hypothetical 'perfectly rational' actor. Be mindful of ways that laws and other power structures can be abused, and try always to avoid them. 

### Postamble

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all humans (homo sapiens) are created as equals, and have certain inalienable rights, and that among these rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
